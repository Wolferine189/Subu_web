 I was born in 2004 A.D. in remote area of Dhagding of Nepal. I am the third child of my parent after my brother and sister.
                    I don't remember much but my life began when my father came to kathmandu with my whole family. I started my initial academics 
                    form NAMESS(National Model English Secondary School) situated in Nepaltar,Kathmamdu. I studied there until my 7th grade and
                     Joined Tarun Mavi till my SEE (Secondary Education Examination). After that to pursue my dream I joined Science Stream choosing
                      the biology in NIST College (National Institute of Science and Technology) located at Lainchour, kathmandu where I passed my 12th standard.
